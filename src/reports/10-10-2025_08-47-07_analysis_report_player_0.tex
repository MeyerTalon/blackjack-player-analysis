\title{Blackjack PBS Analysis \& House-Edge Report \\ {\large Player 0}}

\section*{Executive Summary}
Player 0 played 20 rounds with a total wager of \$200.00, ending with a net loss of \$10.00. The realized house edge of 5.00\% was much higher than the expected edge of 0.65\%, and the actual edge observed at 0.66\% was only slightly above the baseline, indicating a modest increase due to small deviations. The player’s style is classified as Conservative, meaning they tend to take fewer aggressive hits and favor standing, which can reduce risk but also limit upside. Two notable habits that raised the edge were taking a stand on a 2C 3S 7S versus a 3D instead of the basic strategy hit, and taking a hit on 8H 3H against a 7C when basic strategy would double. These choices increased the house edge by about a quarter of a percent and added uncertainty to the session’s outcome.

\section*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Expected (PBS)} is the table’s baseline house edge under perfect basic strategy for the given rules.
  \item \textbf{Expected (Actual)} adds estimated penalties for each deviation from PBS.
  \item \textbf{Realized edge} is computed from outcomes in the CSV and can differ from expectation due to variance.
  \item \textbf{Penalty} refers to the amount of EV the player lost by deviating from PBS. This is equivalent to the increase in house edge.
  \item Penalties are approximate and expressed as percentage of the base bet per round; they are meant for directional analysis.
\end{itemize}
